# Miniature-Automated-Roof-System-with-Arduino-R3
A simple automatic roof using raindrop sensor and servo motor

This miniature was made to fulfill our microcomputer final project. In this system, when the raindrop sensor detects water, the roof will be closed automatically and the buzzer will turn on until the roof is completely closed. In this system there are 2 screens available, the oled screen is used to display the time in realtime while the lcd screen is used to display the status of the system. 

in this project, we need
1. arduino uno R3
2. raindrop sensor
3. buzzer
4. servo motor
5. oled screen
6. lcd screen
